Which model has a lower loss?
The LSTM model based off of the closing prices, over 10 epochs.


Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
The LSTM model based off of the closing prices. FNG is not very accomplished in predicting the stock prices, the model based off of the closing prices is much better at predicting/tracking the actual values over time.


Which window size works best for the model?
The window size of 9 or 10 works best for the model.
